# Finite-State-Automata
My collection of finite state machine simulators

The files that end in "lib" contain the classes. Importing the classes allows you to create instances of that type of automaton. If you would like to run a machine on the command line using a configuration file, then use the files which are not labelled as libraries. For example: "python3 DFA.py config.txt hello" where "config.txt" is the configuration file and "hello" is the input.

To use the empty string "" as input, run the program with only the configuration file. For example: "python3 DFA.py config.txt".
